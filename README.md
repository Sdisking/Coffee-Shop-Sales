# 📊 Project Overview:
In this project, I developed an interactive Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard using MS EXCEL to analyze daily operations, customer behavior, and product performance across three store locations. This helped uncover trends in sales performance, footfall, and product preferences, offering actionable insights for business decision-making.

# 🔍 Key Insights Derived:
📅 Sales Variation by Day and Hour:

Weekday performance: Monday and Friday are the top-performing days with sales exceeding $101,000, followed closely by Wednesday and Thursday.

Weekend dip: Saturday and Sunday see comparatively lower sales, with Saturday being the lowest.

Hourly trend: Peak sales occur between 8 AM and 10 AM, indicating strong morning demand (possibly due to coffee and breakfast purchases).

# ⏰ Peak Sales Times:

Peak hours: 8 AM – 10 AM.

Peak days: Monday and Friday.

These insights can guide staffing, marketing campaigns, and promotional offers during high-traffic windows.

# 📆 Monthly Sales Revenue:
Here's the breakdown of total sales revenue per month:

January: $81,677.74

February: $76,145.19

March: $98,834.68

April: $118,941.08

May: $156,727.76

June: $166,485.88
📈 Insight: There's a clear upward trend in revenue, with June showing the highest sales—more than double the revenue in January. This indicates either seasonal demand or effective business scaling and promotional strategies over time.

# 💰 Average Price/Order Per Person:

Average Sale per Person: $4.69

Average Orders per Person: 1.44

Indicates a relatively low-ticket, high-footfall business model—consistent with café operations.

# 🏆 Best-Selling Products (Quantity & Revenue):

Top 5 Products by Revenue:

Barista Espresso – $91,406.20

Gourmet Brewed Coffee – $70,034.60

Hot Chocolate – $72,416.00

Brewed Black Tea – $47,932.00

These products are key drivers of revenue and should be prioritized in inventory and promotions.

# 📦 Sales by Product Category & Type:
